          <p class="eventsheader">TechCreate announces it's arrival in the Kingdom with Digital Accelerator Forum</p>
          <br>
          
          <p>TechCreate Group jointly held a Digital Accelerator Forum with the Association of Banks in Cambodia at Phnom Penh's Hyatt Regency on August 22, as the Singapore-based technology services provider marked its arrival in the Kingdom in style.</p>
                
          <p>TechCreate Group - a technology services group specialising in innovative digital payment digitalisation solutions IT security and infrastructure solutions - has invested in Cambodia with a local entity to reach out to different sectors within the Kingdom.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>And with this new setup, TechCreate Group is bringing its extensive digitalisation experience to the Kingdom, and joining Cambodia's digital revolution.</p>


          <p>HE Nuon Pharat, the vice-governor of Phnom Penh, was guest of honour at the event presided over by TechCreate Group CEO Lim Heng Hai, and attended by representatives of the group’s partners and the Cambodian banking sector, as well as other distinguished guests.</p>

          <br>

          <p>“In this digital era, we can see there is a great opportunity for using digital technologies to tackle urban issues. Phnom Penh is one of the 26 cities part of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network.</p>
          <p>“Phnom Penh has recently adopted the ‘Smart and Sustainable Strategic Roadmap 2022-2035’, and implemented a number of pilot projects towards digital transformation, integrating technology into our daily urban operations.</p>
          <p>“Phnom Penh is growing alongside the digital policy of the government, with Prime Minister Hun Sen saying he believes Cambodia will strive to achieve digital transformation to bring the Kingdom’s economy and society to a higher level of development.</p>
          <p>“So I would like to express my appreciation for the technology services providers for coming to Phnom Penh to share your experience and best practices, as well as your suggested solutions,” said HE Nuon Pharat.</p>

        

          <p>Lim Heng Hai, TechCreate Group CEO, spoke of the Kingdom’s huge potential.</p>
          <p>“Cambodia is a vibrant economy with many digitalisation opportunities.</p>
          <p>“Through our experience in digitalisation in Asia, we are confident that we can form trusted partnerships with Cambodian banks for their digital journey,” he said.</p>
          <p>After receiving a token of appreciation himself, HE Nuon Pharat as guest of honour presented them to representatives from TechCreate Group’s trusted partners, which include Kong (API management solutions), Mandiant (cybersecurity) and OneSpan (digital agreements/authentications).</p>

      <p>Marking its entry in the Kingdom, the forum was part of TechCreate Group’s efforts to share its digitalisation experience, along with the potential products and services that can allow Cambodian banks to enhance their digital capabilities.</p>
      <p>TechCreate Group has signalled its commitment to aligning with the government’s “Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework 2021-2035” on building a dynamic digital future for the Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Announced in May 2021, the policy sets out a long-term vision to build a vibrant digital economy and society by laying the foundations for promoting digital adoption and transformation across all sectors of society.</p>
      <p>As a trusted partner in digital solutions, TechCreate Group has since its establishment been at the forefront of technological innovation, and has utilised its expertise and extensive operational experience to successfully implement multiple new and innovative digital solutions.</p>
      <p>These include its own proprietary payment solutions, IT cybersecurity, API gateways and blockchain solutions, among others, for banking and financial institutions across Asia.</p>
      <p>TechCreate Group also works with some of the industry’s leading experts in cyber security and secured infrastructure services, combined with market leading technologies to provide a springboard for the next phase of digital transformation.</p>
      <p>According to a November 2020 Mckinsey report, Asia has outpaced all other regions in terms of payments-revenue growth over the past years.</p>
      <p>The region is also the largest contributor to global payments revenue, generating over $900 billion in 2019, nearly half the global total.</p>
      <p>With a focus on powering the future of payments in Asia, TechCreate Group aims to provide cutting-edge innovation and technology capability to enhance value creation for its customers.</p>
      <p>“We are confident that together with our partners within the region, we can promote sustainable finance and deliver new value and insights to better serve our Cambodian customers</p>
      <p>“On top of that, Phnom Penh, Battambang and Siem Reap have been chosen to participate in ASEAN’s Smart Cities Network.</p>
      <p>“We are hoping that we will be able to complement and provide smart security, mobility and sustainability solutions to these cities,” said Ronald Vong, managing partner of TechCreate Group.</p>
